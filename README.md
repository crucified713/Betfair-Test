# Front End Technical Test 1
This is to showcase my approach of how I tackle problem and plan in advance in real life, such as been asked to build a web page in 4 hours. 

## Instructions ##
A simple wireframe is attached for you to implement in the stack of your choosing.

1. Maximum of 4 hours to complete
2. Site should be responsive for mobile with a minimum size of 320px, the designer has forgotten the mobile designs so please use your best judgement on how you would adapt the design to mobile
3. Site should contain a carousel that works on all devices
4. Please use the modal pop out where you think it may be applicable
5. Feel free to code in your framework of choice (React, Angular etc.)

## My Thoughts on Dev
1. After I saw the wireframe and the 4 hours time limit, I realised I must choose appropriate tools/JS libraries to help me efficiently build this web page, rather than reinventing the wheel. As it doesn't involve data binding, state management nor life cycles, using ReactJS/AnguarJS seemed over-engineering, therefore I decided to use jQuery library. Additionally I used SASS, Gulp, and Browser-sync to make my development more efficient.

2. I used FlexSlider JS library for displaying the hero slider, and FancyBox for image enlarging and modal popup. Both library work across all devices.

3. Layout and theme in general was not hard to pick up, so I initialised SASS files with standard layout and theme, and collected theme colours via colour picker tool.

4. Heading & body fonts are all sans-serif, however body font seemed like a custom font so I used a similar Google font 'Montserrat' instead of Ariel.

5. Design was straightforward so I just followed along. As no tablet/mobile design provided I decided to simply stack up each small blocks or reduce the total amount of columns in a row when viewport width reached tablet/mobile size.

6. Modal will be displayed when you click on "VISIT SITE" button.
